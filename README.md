# Cloud network

Code used in going deep in cloud computing per a graduate school class, including standing up VM networks, a Kubernetes cluster, and native Kubernetes autoscaling experiments.

- [autoscaling/](autoscaling/README.md) - experiments with autoscaling in Kubernetes
- [VM network via Ansible](vm-network-ansible/README.md) - set up multiple VMs networked together to learn IaC via Ansible
- [Kubernetes Ansible playbooks](kubernetes-playbooks/) - Stand up a Kubernetes cluster on the VM network using Ansible
- [Inference App](inference-app/) - multi-microservice-based application with heavy communication and coordination, for doing ML image recognition, as a good test app
