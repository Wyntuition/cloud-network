# Purpose: 
#    This yaml file declares the different variables. It uses
#    a Python dictionary syntax
#

# I have already defined these two variables, which are used
# in the master playbook.
# @@ make sure to add the local user's username @@
local_user: wyn

cloud_user: cc  # user on chameleon VMs is cc

# @@ You have to add additional variables here that you need
#    in the different children playbooks. This could be things
#    like VM properties such as VM name prefix, the flavor like
#    m1.medium, project number and all the things you need to
#    create the VM.
# @@

# variables.yaml

# Prefix to use for naming the VMs
vm_name_prefix: "chameleon-vm"

# Flavor of the VM (VM size)
vm_flavor: "m1.medium"  # Adjust to the flavor you need

# Image ID or name to use for the VM
vm_image: "Ubuntu-22.04"  # Replace with the correct image for your project

# Network to attach the VMs to
vm_network: "private"

# SSH keypair to use for accessing the VMs
vm_keypair: "my-ssh-key"  # Replace with the name of your keypair

# Number of VMs to create
vm_count: 4  # Set the desired number of VMs to create

# Timeout in seconds for the VM creation process
